## Project setup

- We are using an angular-boilerplate to generate and setup the inital configuration of this project. Follow the instructions from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-angular-boilerplate) making the necessary changes.
  - in this project, we are using Typescript + Jade, so be sure to select these options when prompted
  - though we selected to use Jade, the boilerplate creates some HTML files, so, as first task, convert the main.html and navbar.html to jade files.
